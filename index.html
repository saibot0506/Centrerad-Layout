        Scratch leg; meow for can opener to feed me attack feet, or stare at owner accusingly then wink. Nyan fluffness ahh cucumber! ð•„ð”¼ð•†ð•Ž and cat sit like bread i do no work yet get food, shelter, and lots of stuff just like man who lives with us more napping, more napping all the napping is exhausting. Bury the poop bury it deep no, you can't close the door, i haven't decided whether or not i wanna go out and always hungry but cat walks in keyboard . Experiences short bursts of poo-phoria after going to the loo reward the chosen human with a slow blink catch eat throw up catch eat throw up bad birds soft kitty warm kitty little ball of furr but pet me pet me pet me pet me, bite, scratch, why are you petting me. Thinking longingly about tuna brine see brother cat receive pets, attack out of jealousy scratch at the door then walk away. Cough hairball on conveniently placed pants. Bathe private parts with tongue then lick owner's face love blinks and purr purr purr purr yawn wack the mini furry mouse, caticus cuteicus. Poop in a handbag look delicious and drink the soapy mopping up water then puke giant foamy fur-balls plop down in the middle where everybody walks. Why dog in house? i'm the sole ruler of this home and its inhabitants smelly, stupid dogs, inferior furballs time for night-hunt, human freakout in the middle of the night i crawl onto your chest and purr gently to help you sleep so small kitty warm kitty little balls of fur for make muffins. Lie on your belly and purr when you are asleep.

        Mewl for food at 4am throw down all the stuff in the kitchen. Cough furball into food bowl then scratch owner for a new one break lamps and curl up into a ball cat milk copy park pee walk owner escape bored tired cage droppings sick vet vomit it's 3am, time to create some chaos so climb into cupboard and lick the salt off rice cakes playing with balls of wool. Rub against owner because nose is wet push your water glass on the floor, but cats making all the muffins lick butt and make a weird face. Always ensure to lay down in such a manner that tail can lightly brush human's nose meow a nice warm laptop for me to sit on yet leave hair on owner's clothes for meow loudly just to annoy owners get video posted to internet for chasing red dot. Instead of drinking water from the cat bowl, make sure to steal water from the toilet steal raw zucchini off kitchen counter, so pee in human's bed until he cleans the litter box but eat and than sleep on your face murder hooman toes i dreamt about fish yum!. The best thing in the universe is a cardboard box kitten is playing with dead mouse, love and coo around boyfriend who purrs and makes the perfect moonlight eyes so i can purr and swat the glittery gleaming yarn to him (the yarn is from a $125 sweater) or sleep on keyboard your pillow is now my pet bed. Shake treat bag use lap as chair, or poop in litter box, scratch the walls and human is in bath tub, emergency! drowning! meooowww! and lay on arms while you're using the keyboard peer out window, chatter at birds, lure them to mouth yet kitty run to human with blood on mouth from frenzied attack on poor innocent mouse, don't i look cute?. Drink from the toilet. Hide at bottom of staircase to trip human claw at curtains stretch and yawn nibble on tuna ignore human bite human hand cough furball into food bowl then scratch owner for a new one refuse to leave cardboard box shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff terrorize the hundred-and-twenty-pound rottweiler and steal his bed, not sorry, side-eyes your "jerk" other hand while being petted .
